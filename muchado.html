                                so occupied with the rough, violent task ahead of me that there was
                                no chance that <i>like</i> would turn

                                back, the room in my head that I used to fill with war plans has
                                become crowded with soft and delicate feelings. They all lead me to
                                the same thought—how beautiful young Hero is and how I
                                must have liked her even before I left to fight.</div>

                                Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves. They should look
                                for themselves, without asking someone else to get involved in their
                                affairs. Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into
                                passion. This happens a lot, but it didn’t occur to me

<b>BORACHIO</b>
<div class="modern-line">Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone. Tell them
                                you know that Hero loves me. Pretend to be very concerned about both
                                the Prince, who has compromised his honor by making the match, and
                                Claudio, whose reputation will be ruined by this woman
                                who’s pretending to be a virgin. Of course, they
                                won’t believe you without proof. Tell them
                                you’ve seen the two of us at Hero’s bedroom
                                window, and then bring them to see for themselves on the night
                                before the wedding. I’ll arrange it so that Hero is away
                                for the night, so what they’ll actually see is Margaret
                                and me at the window, calling each other
                                “Hero” and <a class="tooltip-link" href="javascript:void(0);"><span class="tooltip-css tooltip-background"><h4 class="semi-bold">“Claudio.”</h4><p>Some editors assume “Claudio” is an error, and change it to “Borachio.”</p></span>“Claudio.”</a> It’ll be such blatant evidence of
                                Hero’s disloyalty that Claudio’s jealousy will
                                quickly turn to certainty, and the wedding will be instantly called
                                off.</div>

                                That’s the kind of man Claudio is. I knew him when he
                                listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would

                                well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his
                                room designing himself a fancy new jacket. He used to speak plainly
                                and to the point, like an honorable man and soldier; now his speech

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<div class="modern-line">
<i>(coming forward)</i> This
                                can’t be a trick. They spoke with great seriousness, and
                                they have Hero’s testimony. They seem to pity the lady.
                                It seems her love is stretched to the limit. She loves me? Well,
                                that love must be returned! I hear how I’m criticized.
                                They say I’ll be smug if I find out she loves me. They
                                also say she’d rather die than give any sign of her
                                feelings. I never thought I’d marry. I can’t
                                appear to be proud. People who discover their faults and can then
                                change them are lucky indeed. They say the lady is beautiful;
                                it’s true, I’ve seen it myself. And virtuous;
                                that’s true, I can’t disprove that. And smart,
                                except that she loves me. That may not be any proof of her
                                intelligence, but I swear it won’t be evidence of her
                                stupidity—for I’m going to be horribly in love
                                with her! People might tease me here and there, since I attacked
                                marriage for so long. But don’t tastes change? A man can
                                love a dish when he is young that he hates when he turns old. Will
                                quips and clever remarks and scathing written words keep a man from
                                getting what his heart desires? No! The world needs to be populated.
                                When I said that I’d die as a bachelor, I just meant that
                                I didn’t think I’d live until I got married.
                                Here comes Beatrice. By God! She’s a beautiful lady. I
                                think I sense some signs of love in her.</div>

                                conversing has turned men into tongues—and fancy ones, at
                                that. The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as
                                brave as Hercules. I can’t make myself a man by wishing I
                                were, so as a woman I’ll die, from grieving.</div>

                                father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and
                                ask<i>him</i> to be patient. Compare the
                                length and width of that man’s sadness against my own;
                                match up all the complaints and strong emotions that run through our
                                bodies. If a man who has suffered as I have gave me advice the way
                                you do—smiling and stroking his beard, telling me to toss
                                away my sorrow, giving speeches when he should be wailing with me,
                                trying to heal my grief with little proverbs, spinning my head
                                around with philosophy—then I would take his advice and
                                be patient. But that man doesn’t exist. You can try to
                                comfort a man who feels a pain that you have never felt, but once
                                you feel it too, your sober advice will also turn into passion. You
                                can’t treat madness with rules or bind up insanity with
                                little silken threads or cure heartache with hot air or lighten

<div class="modern-line">Benedick, Beatrice praised your wit the other day. I said you had
                                a fine wit. “True,” she said, “a
                                fine little one.” “No,” I said,
                                “a huge wit.” “Right,”
                                she said, “a hugely awful one.”
                                “No,” I said, “he has a good
                                wit.” “Exactly,” she said,
                                “it’s good and mild; it doesn’t
                                hurt anyone.” “No,” I said,
                                “Benedick is wise.” “He is
                                certainly,” she said, <a class="tooltip-link" href="javascript:void(0);"><span class="tooltip-css tooltip-background"><h4 class="semi-bold">“a wise gentleman.”</h4><p>“A wise gentleman” was often used to describe an old, foolish man.</p></span>“a wise gentleman.”</a>“No,” I said, “he can speak
                                many languages:” “I can believe
                                that,” she said, “because he swore one thing
                                to me on Monday night and took it back on Tuesday morning. He spoke
                                two languages then.” She turned all your virtues into
                                vices just about an hour ago. But in the end she sighed and admitted
                                you were the handsomest man in Italy.</div>
