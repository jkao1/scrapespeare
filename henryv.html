<b>CHORUS</b>
<div class="original-line">Oh, for a muse of fire that would ascend</div>
<div class="original-line">The brightest heaven of invention!</div>
<div class="original-line">A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,</div>
<div class="original-line">And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</div>
<div class="original-line">Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</div>
<div class="original-line">Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels,</div>
<div class="original-line">Leashed in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire</div>
<div class="original-line">Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,</div>
<div class="original-line">The flat unraisèd spirits that hath dared</div>
<div class="original-line">On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</div>
<div class="original-line">So great an object. Can this cockpit hold</div>
<div class="original-line">The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram</div>
<div class="original-line">Within this wooden <i>O</i> the very casques</div>
<div class="original-line">That did affright the air at Agincourt?</div>
<div class="original-line">O pardon, since a crookèd figure may</div>
<div class="original-line">Attest in little place a million,</div>
<div class="original-line">And let us, ciphers to this great account,</div>
<div class="original-line">On your imaginary forces work.</div>
<div class="original-line">Suppose within the girdle of these walls</div>
<div class="original-line">Are now confined two mighty monarchies</div>
<div class="original-line">Whose high uprearèd and abutting fronts</div>
<div class="original-line">The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.</div>
<div class="original-line">Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.</div>
<div class="original-line">Into a thousand parts divide one man,</div>
<div class="original-line">And make imaginary puissance.</div>
<div class="original-line">Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them</div>
<div class="original-line">Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth,</div>
<div class="original-line">For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</div>
<div class="original-line">Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,</div>
</td><td class="noFear-right">
<b>CHORUS</b>
<div class="modern-line">If only we had divine inspiration, our play might rise to the highest level of imagination. If we had a stage as big as a kingdom, real kings and queens to act the part of kings and queens, and royalty to also witness the glorious spectacle, then it would be as it really was. Then valiant King Harry would resemble the god of war, as he did in life, and famine, sword, and fire would sit like dogs at his feet, waiting to be unleashed.</div>
<div class="modern-line">But, ladies and gentlemen, since that’s not the case, you must forgive us plain, ordinary men who dare to act out so great a story on this humble stage. Can this theater seem to contain the sweeping fields of France? Could we even squeeze into this little theater the helmets that looked so frightening at Agincourt? Hardly! But, pardon us, because just as a few strokes of a pen, a few zeros, can signify a huge number, we, who are zeros in this great story, can work on your imagination. Pretend that within the confines of this theater sit two great kingdoms divided by a narrow but perilous ocean. Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections. Divide each man into a thousand, and there you will have an imaginary army. Imagine, when we talk of horses, that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth. Because now it is your thoughts that must dress up our kings and transport them from place to place. Your thoughts must leap over huge spans of time, turning the events of many</div>
