A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin. And a sinner who does something good is only patched up with goodness. If this logic works, that’s great. If not, what can you do about it? Since the only real betrayed husband in the world is the one deserted by Lady Luck—because we’re all married to her—beauty is a flower.

surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang with arguments of
state. Put thyself into the trick of singularity,” and
consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a
reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of
note, and so forth. I have limed her, but it is Jove’s doing,
and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now,
“Let this fellow be looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,”
nor after my degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres
together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple,
no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—what
can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and
the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer

Talk about politics and affairs of state, and act free and independent.” And then she explains how to do it: I should have a serious face and dignified demeanor, well-modulated speech, acting like a distinguished gentleman and so on. I’ve got her now, but I’ve got God to thank for it! And when she left just now, she said “Take care of this poor fellow here.” Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” not anything referring to my low station in life, but “fellow.” Everything’s going perfectly. Not the tiniest ounce, not the littlest insignificant amount of trouble or bad luck could ruin it—what can I say? Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes. Well, God is responsible for that, not me, and he deserves thanks.</div>

<div class="modern-line">I’m sorry, Malvolio, but this isn’t my writing, though I admit it looks like mine. It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting. Now that I think about it, Maria was the one who first told me you were insane. That’s when you came in smiling at me, dressed up like the letter said, and acting just like it told you to act. Someone has played a very mean trick on you, but when we find out who’s responsible, you won’t just be the victim, but the judge who sentences the culprit. I promise.</div>

<div class="modern-line">Madam, let me say something. Please don’t let squabbles ruin this beautiful and miraculous moment. I confess that Toby and I were the ones who tricked Malvolio because we hated his strict and heavy-handed ways. Sir Toby had Maria wrote that letter, and he married her as a reward. We should just laugh about the whole thing rather than get upset about it, especially if we consider that each of the two parties offended the other equally.</div>
