<div class="modern-line">Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you. There’s a feud between Albany and Cornwall, although they’ve been clever enough to hide it thus far. Like other powerful rulers, they have servants who are actually French spies in disguise. These spies have noticed something, perhaps in the squabbles between Albany and Cornwall, or in the tough line both of them have taken against the good old king, or perhaps in some deeper matter at the root of both of these problems—The point is that the King of France has sent troops into our divided kingdom. Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war. Now this is where you come in. If you trust me enough to hurry to Dover, you’ll earn the gratitude of many people when you fairly report the monstrous and maddening extent of the king’s suffering. I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.</div>

<div class="modern-line">This would be a great night to satisfy a whore’s lust. I’ll recite a prophecy before I go.</div>
<div class="modern-line">One day, when priests don’t practice what they preach,</div>
<div class="modern-line">When brewers dilute their beer with water,</div>
<div class="modern-line">When noblemen teach their tailors how to sew,</div>
<div class="modern-line">When instead of heretics being burned at the stake, lovers are burned by syphilis,</div>
<div class="modern-line">When every law case is tried fairly,</div>
<div class="modern-line">When no gentleman is in debt,</div>
<div class="modern-line">When no one slanders anyone else,</div>
<div class="modern-line">And thieves don’t snatch wallets in crowds,</div>
<div class="modern-line">When moneylenders count their gold in the open air,</div>
<div class="modern-line">And pimps and whores build fine churches—</div>
<div class="modern-line">Then the kingdom of England</div>
<div class="modern-line">Will come to ruin.</div>
<div class="modern-line">And whoever lives to see that day</div>
<div class="modern-line">Will walk with his feet.</div>
